                    <h3>Software Engineer, <br/>BookingGo</h3>
                    <h4>November 2018 - Present</h4>
                    <p><p>Worked on the Landing Pages team as a <em>Full-Stack developer</em> in a large scale replatforming project that managed to increase the scalability, performance, accessibility and development speed of the platform.
The work involved breaking a large monolithic <em>Java</em> application into small data-driver dockerized <em>microservices</em>. The technology used was <em>Java SpringBoot</em> for the API data layer, <em>NodeJS</em> and <em>React</em> for the presentation layer.</p>

<ul>
  <li>As part of the team, I was responsible for putting over a million landing pages onto the new platform, enabling over 10 000 customers per day to have an improved experience.</li>
  <li>Improved the platform’s reliability, alerting and monitoring by implementing <em>Prometheus</em> metrics and <em>Jaeger</em> Tracing into our solution. These metrics enabled us to create monitoring dashboards and alerted us during live issues, slow network traffic or outages.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Provided 24-hour support as an on-call engineer and solved difficult problems during outages and live issues out of hours.</li>
  <li>Created an algorithm for optimising crane retrieval movements, which made it 20% cheaper and efficient to pull products from storage.</li>
  <li>Led an initiative to create a solution for warehouse simulations, which allowed the team to troubleshoot live issues as well as catch bugs in early stages during testing. The solution also helped us improve our defect age and decreased development cycle time.</li>
