                <h1>About</h1>
                <p><p>My name is Plamen Kolev and I specialize in web application development, system automation, and software deployment. I have over 3 years of experience working in world-leading companies as a software engineer.  </p>

<p>I am a strong team player and like taking initiative and ownership of the work that I do. I have experience with established technologies such as Enterprise <em>Java</em>, <em>Perl</em>, <em>Ruby</em>, <em>Bash</em>, <em>Linux</em> and <em>MYSQL</em> databases.<br>
I have also worked with new and emerging technologies such as <em>Docker</em>, <em>Hazelcast</em>; in-memory data grid, <em>AWS</em>: Amazon Web Services, <em>React</em> and <em>NodeJS</em>. In my
professional experience, I have used established software engineering patterns to deliver high quality, reliable, and robust software.</p>

<p>I use <em>Scrum</em> and <em>Agile</em> methodologies to deliver incremental and sustainable solutions and have practiced extreme programming, pairing and mobbing to create higher-quality, mature software. I also have experience in <em>TDD</em>: Test-Driven  Development.  </p>

<p><em>Linux</em> is an important part of my developer toolbox and I can use the build-in tools to efficiently automate and speed up developer tasks.<br>
I have strong grasp of advanced <em>Git</em> version control features and can utilise them to effectively collaborate in a team.</p>

                    <h2>Software Engineer, <br/>BookingGo</h2>
                    <h3>November 2018 - Present</h3>
                    <p><p>Worked on the Landing Pages team in a large scale replatforming project that managed to increase the scalability, performance, accessibility and development speed of the platform.</p>

<p>As part of the team, I was responsible for putting every airport page (over 10 000 pages) onto the new platform, enabling over 1 000 customers per day to have an improved experience.<br>
I have also worked on improving the platform&#39;s reliability, alerting and monitoring by implementing <em>Prometheus</em> metrics and <em>Jaeger</em> Tracing into our solution.</p>

<p>My experience at Booking has given me the opportunity to write full-stack software solutions by using <em>NodeJs</em> Javascript framework and <em>React</em>.</p>

                    <h2>Software Engineer, <br/>The Hut Group</h2>
                    <h3>August 2017 - October 2018</h3>
                    <p><p>My responsibilities at The Hut Group were to develop their proprietary Warehouse Management Platform that is responsible for shipping thousands of products each day from their warehouses located across the world.</p>

<p>The stack that I worked in was <em>Java</em> 8 event-based <em>microservices</em> deployed on our <em>AWS</em> cluster.</p>

<p>The job was very challenging due to the warehouses operating at full capacity 24 hours every day. I provided support as an on-call engineer, troubleshooting difficult problems during outages and live issues both during work and out of hours.</p>

<p>Due to the complexity of the warehouse software, a lot of time was wasted in manual testing. I identified that we can create an automation tool and as a result, I led an initiative to create a solution for warehouse simulations.</p>

<p>It helped us troubleshoot live issues as well as catch bugs in development. It also led to decreased development cycle time and improved our defect age.</p>

                    <p><p>worked on high-performing, Cyber Security project. 
My responsibilities were to extend the in-house automation framework, which is responsible for ensuring that the Data Loss Prevention and Email threat detection engine cannot be exploited by attackers.</p>

<p>I was responsible for extending the framework, which was written in <em>Perl</em>, as well as creating new automation test suits. I would also troubleshoot software bugs by using the <em>BASH</em> scripting language and an array of built-in <em>Linux</em> command-line tools in a <em>virtualized</em> environment.</p>

<p>At Intel, I was given the task to write a UI automation framework using <em>Perl</em> and <em>Selenium Web Driver</em>. After the solution was delivered, I created training sessions to teach the testing engineers about the tool.</p>
